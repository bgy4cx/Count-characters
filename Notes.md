# **Count characters in your string**

[[Count characters in your string](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52efefcbcdf57161d4000091/javascript)]

## **Task**

>The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like aba, then the result should be {'a': 2, 'b': 1}.
>What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, {}.

## **Notes**

### Guardiens
- Input is a string ☑️
- In case of empty sting the result is empty. 
- output is an object

### Process
- We have to count the number of the characters.
